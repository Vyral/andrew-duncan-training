They discuss why the Duncan Duo team agents average 5x as many home sales in their first year as new agents on average and how their marketing and coaching system ensures agent success.Learn more about joining The Duncan Duo team by emailing &#099;&#097;&#114;&#101;&#101;&#114;&#115;&#064;&#084;&#104;&#101;&#068;&#117;&#110;&#099;&#097;&#110;&#068;&#117;&#111;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109; or by registering for one of our upcoming career nights at www.JoinTheDuo.com.If you are considering getting into the real estate business in Tampa Bay or becoming a Realtor in Tampa, send us an email at &#099;&#097;&#114;&#101;&#101;&#114;&#115;&#064;&#084;&#104;&#101;&#068;&#117;&#110;&#099;&#097;&#110;&#068;&#117;&#111;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109; or click here to visit the Tampa Real Estate Careers Page on our website.

In this episode, they are answering the question “Why should you sell your house if you’re worried about finding another one to buy?” This is a fear that a lot of people have especially with the recent statistics from GTAR showing that there’s only 2.4 months of inventory which is a record low for over a decade.Andrew gives some tips on how to make the best decision out of the situation. There are people who are able to buy before they sell and in a competitive market  like this, it might be something you may want to consider.If you want to sell and then buy, there are ways to do that, too. The Duncan Duo team offers the guaranteed sale program wherein they sell your home in 29 days or they buy it.Another option is selling your home and moving into something in between like an apartment to make sure you take your time to look for the right home instead of rushing and choosing the wrong one.If you are considering getting into the real estate business in Tampa Bay or becoming a Realtor in Tampa, send us an email at careers@TheDuncanDuo.com or click here to visit the Tampa Real Estate Careers Page on our website.

A lot of times the appraisers are working within a box that the lenders have given them. They share their experience on having deals fall through because of low appraisals.

        "content": "Thinking of building a career in Real Estate? Andrew Duncan of The Duncan Duo, #1 Real Estate Agents in the US, gives tips to help you make that decision.If you are thinking about going into sales, you need to have an outgoing personality. You need to be comfortable talking to people. You need to have a little bit of competitive streak and you need to be comfortable with a fluctuating income. Real estate sales in the most part don’t pay a salary. You make income based on how may homes people buy or sell.If you don’t have an outgoing personality but still love real estate, there are behind the scenes positions available like operations positions, transaction coordinator positions, administrative positions, that might be right for you.The first step when you decide to build a career in real estate is for you to get a real estate license. It opens up a variety of options for you in terms of paths that you can go. Working without a license will limit what you can and can’t do in real estate. He encourages you to check out Bob Hogue School of Real Estate and Burk Cooke Real estate school to help you get your Real estate license.He also encourages you to talk to a lot of different agents and companies. Not all companies are right for every agent.Another thing you need to remember is to have a solid income expectations. He even recommends for you to have at least 6 months worth of bill payments saved before going into real estate as there will be times that you will have fluctuating incomes. He doesn’t want anyone to get out of the business before they start to be successful.Ready to start your career in Real Estate?

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "I got an email recently from someone thinking about getting into the real estate business who asked me whether they should hire a coach.In my opinion, yes you should hire a coach. All professionals have coaches. The most successful people in the world have coaches and consultants. I have a coach named Bobby Corcoran, whom I’ve coached with for several years and consider the very best coach in the business.No matter which path you take, you need a real estate coach. Whether it’s a systems coach, a scripts and dialogue coach, a marketing coach, or you join a team that already has a top agent doing the existing coaching for them. Having a coach means having someone who will hold you accountable, which is crucial to success in the real estate business. A coach can notice things that you don’t notice, give you action plans, and teach you from experience what works for their most successful customers.“HIRING A COACH IS CRUCIAL TO SUCCESS IN THE REAL ESTATE BUSINESS.”As far as what kind of coach you should hire, that depends on what kind of agent you intend to become. Are you an individual agent? Are you a team member? Do you want to focus on a certain niche in the business? What do you want to get out of your real estate career?The most important piece of advice I can give to you is if you’re going to hire a coach, listen to them. I can’t count all the times I’ve talked to other coaches in the business who’ve told me they’re frustrated because someone is paying them great money but they’re not listening to them. If you’re going to hire a coach, trust them and listen to their advice. Most of the time, they’re probably right.Be sure to check out our website for more educational real estate tips. If you have any other questions, please feel free to give me a call or shoot me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!",

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "What can a new real estate agent expect in their first year? To give you an idea, let me summarize how my first year as a real estate agent went.I was in my mid-twenties with a college degree in hand. I had been in a sales position for several years, but then I decided to join a real estate company. In my first year, I lost money. I sold very little real estate and just wasn’t very successful at all.Unfortunately, that’s the story with most first-year real estate agents. A high percentage of them don’t make the cut and never come back because they go to the wrong place and believe they can generate enough business to have a successful income. Fortunately, I was able to persist, educate myself about the business, and become very successful.“DON’T HAVE HIGH EXPECTATIONS ABOUT YOUR PRODUCTION IN YOUR FIRST YEAR.”You shouldn’t have super high expectations about production in your first year, though. Your first year is about building a pipeline, covering a niche, and figuring out what you’re good at and what you’re not good at while you adapt to an independent contract-type career. Focus on getting as much education as you can and learning the basics.If you’re an independent agent, you’ll have to do a lot of these things on your own. If you join a team, however, there is marketing, education, training, coaching, and leads immediately available to take advantage of. For anyone getting into the business, joining a team is the option I would encourage.If you have any other questions about how to navigate the first year of your real estate career, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email.
