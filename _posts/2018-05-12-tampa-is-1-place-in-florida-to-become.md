<a href="http://www.theduncanduo.com/" target="_blank">Andrew Duncan</a> talks with several co-hosts about how it was recently announced that Tampa is the #1 city in Florida for becoming a real estate agent.  The group talks about how important it is to join a team that has marketing and training power and how many agents fail in their first year because they join the wrong company.  They discuss why the Duncan Duo team agents average 5x as many home sales in their first year as new agents on average and how their marketing and coaching system ensures agent success.
