Here are <a href="http://www.theduncanduo.com/" target="_blank">Andrew and Angela Duncan</a> in their monthly series, "The Duo Talks," where they answer questions from radio listeners, people who follow them in social media or customers about what is going on in the Real Estate market to give them the best advice possible and help them make the best real estate decisions. In this episode, they are answering the question “Why should you sell your house if you’re worried about finding another one to buy?” This is a fear that a lot of people have especially with the recent statistics from GTAR showing that there's only 2.4 months of inventory which is a record low for over a decade.

Andrew gives some tips on how to make the best decision out of the situation. There are people who are able to buy before they sell and in a competitive market  like this, it might be something you may want to consider.

If you want to sell and then buy, there are ways to do that, too. The Duncan Duo team offers the guaranteed sale program wherein they sell your home in 29 days or they buy it.

Another option is selling your home and moving into something in between like an apartment to make sure you take your time to look for the right home instead of rushing and choosing the wrong one.
