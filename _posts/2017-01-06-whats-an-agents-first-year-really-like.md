{% include youtube.html %}What can a new real estate agent expect in their first year? To give you an idea, let me summarize how my first year as a real estate agent went.

I was in my mid-twenties with a college degree in hand. I had been in a sales position for several years, but then I decided to join a real estate company. In my first year, I lost money. I sold very little real estate and just wasn’t very successful at all.

Unfortunately, that’s the story with most first-year real estate agents. A high percentage of them don’t make the cut and never come back because they go to the wrong place and believe they can generate enough business to have a successful income. Fortunately, I was able to persist, educate myself about the business, and become very successful.

You shouldn’t have super high expectations about production in your first year, though. Your first year is about building a pipeline, covering a niche, and figuring out what you’re good at and what you’re not good at while you adapt to an independent contract-type career. **Focus on getting as much education as you can and learning the basics.**

If you’re an independent agent, you’ll have to do a lot of these things on your own. If you join a team, however, there is marketing, education, training, coaching, and leads immediately available to take advantage of. For anyone getting into the business, joining a team is the option I would encourage.

If you have any other questions about how to navigate the first year of your real estate career, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to talk with you!
