{% include youtube.html %}I got an email recently from someone thinking about getting into the real estate business who asked me whether they should hire a coach.

In my opinion, **yes you should hire a coach.** All professionals have coaches. The most successful people in the world have coaches and consultants. I have a coach named Bobby Corcoran, whom I’ve coached with for several years and consider the very best coach in the business.

No matter which path you take, you need a real estate coach. Whether it’s a systems coach, a scripts and dialogue coach, a marketing coach, or you join a team that already has a top agent doing the existing coaching for them. **Having a coach means having someone who will hold you accountable, which is crucial to success in the real estate business.** A coach can notice things that you don’t notice, give you action plans, and teach you from experience what works for their most successful customers.

As far as what kind of coach you should hire, that depends on what kind of agent you intend to become. Are you an individual agent? Are you a team member? Do you want to focus on a certain niche in the business? What do you want to get out of your real estate career?

The most important piece of advice I can give to you is **if you’re going to hire a coach, listen to them.** I can’t count all the times I’ve talked to other coaches in the business who’ve told me they’re frustrated because someone is paying them great money but they’re not listening to them. If you’re going to hire a coach, trust them and listen to their advice. Most of the time, they’re probably right.
